# Testing 

Unit tests have been written for most of the pre-processing steps. Most of the other steps for set up interact with the network or are related to model building.

To run the tests, in your terminal type the following:

```bash
pytest
```

If everything runs correctly, your pre-processing steps are complete and accurate.

Please remember to type the command in the main repository and not within one of the folders.
