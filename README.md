## Project Charter 

**Vision**: 
[Research at NYU](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2011/fall/effects) has shown that supervisor-employee relationship affects job performance. But before you build a relationship with your supervisor, it’s important to understand what type of a boss your supervisor is. Understanding their personality would help you better bond with your boss and develop an effective working relationship with them. The question, however, is who IS your boss? The “Who’s the boss?” app enables you to determine if your boss is a Michael Scott or a Dwight K. Schrute, characters from the award-winning American sitcom “The Office”. Depending on who your boss is more like, you can work towards developing a better relationship with them.

**Mission**: 
The app will be designed to take a user input in the form of “things that your boss says”. The model will generate a prediction of whether the person is a Michael Scott or a Dwight Schrute.

**Success criteria**: 

a) The model that will be generated will make predictions about whether the text is more strongly attributed towards Michael Scott or Dwight Schrute. The accuracy of said model can be determined as follows:

Accuracy = (# of correct attributions/ Total # of quotes) *100

We hope to achieve an accuracy of over **70%**.

b) The user is able to rate the app based on the predictions they receive and how accurate they believe it to be. This metric will be used to calculate user satisfaction. A rating of 3.5 or above (on a scale of 5) would be acceptable. Additionally, we will also track the number of times the app is visited to determine user engagement.
